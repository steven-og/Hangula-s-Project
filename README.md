## Site Structure

### Pages

1. **Home** – intro text, service highlights, and a “Let’s Talk” call-to-action.
2. **Services We Provide** – Lists 3 services: IT Consulting, Web Development, and Optimization. Includes a “Why Choose Us” section.
3. **About Us** – Contains “Our Mission”, “Our Story”, and a highlighted quote.
4. **Contact Us** – WPForms contact form with validation (required fields + email format). Includes a short prompt to reach out.
5. **IT Blog** – Blog listing page with 3 posts.

### Custom Post Type (CPT)

* **Services** CPT created to model offerings.
* Includes archive (`archive-service.php`) and single templates (`single-service.php`) in the child theme.

---

## Security

* **Pretty permalinks enabled** (`/post-name/`).
* **Login attempt limiting** via *Limit Login Attempts Reloaded*.
* **User enumeration blocked** via *Stop User Enumeration*.

---

## Performance & Accessibility

* **Caching:** WP Fastest Cache.
* **Image compression:** Optimized images via Starter Templates + Elementor.
* **Performance Lighthouse score:** 82 on Home Page.
* **Accessibility Lighthouse score:** 92 on Home Page.
* Fully responsive across **desktop, tablet, and mobile**.

---

## Architecture Notes & Trade-Offs

* **Astra** was chosen as the base theme due to its lightweight nature and compatibility with Elementor.
* A **child theme (Hangula Child Theme)** was used to safely override styles and add CPT templates.
* **Elementor + Starter Templates** were used for rapid layout design, trading some performance for speed of development.
* Performance was boosted with **WP Fastest Cache** and **Seraphinite Accelerator**, but more tuning (e.g., image lazy-loading, CDN) could raise the score further.
* Security tasks were kept minimal but essential: blocking user enumeration and limiting brute force attacks.
